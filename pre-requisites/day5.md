# STANDARD TEMPLATE LIBRARY (STL)
> STLs are C++ specific.

_The Java version of STL's are collections_

* In C++ STLs, we get,
1) Collections (array, sets, maps, vectors)
2) Iterators
3) Data Structures (stacks, queues, linked list)

# STACKS
> Non-primitive linear data structure
* Last in First out approach

Important functions is stack
1) Push
2) Pop
3) Top
4) isEmpty
